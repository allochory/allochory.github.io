description: Formed over 200 years ago, l'X, as it's known in France, is both a military and engineering school.  Students who manage to enter by a concours study under the title of "polytechniciens" and recieve a salary from the government.  The school is world renowned for its math and physics, but the studies are more broad than those of most French universities... plus, they get swords!
